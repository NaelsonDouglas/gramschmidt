# gramschmidt
It's a simple gram schmidt orthonormal basis calculator writen in Julia language

To use it just import gramschmidt.jl into Julia with
include("../gramschmidt.jl")

and to use you only must call the function gramschimidt(array) with the base you wanna orthonormalize as an array.

Example:
gramschimidt([1 2 3; 3 2 1; -1 0 3])



It's relatively simple code, it was created as an activity of the Linear Algebra course on the Federal University of Alagoas (Brazil) under the revision of professor Andr√© Flores.
